        Building a Tic-Tac-Toe game in React enhanced my understanding of core concepts like state management using <code>useState</code>, dynamic rendering with conditional statements, and the importance of a modular component-based structure. Event handling was employed for user interactions, and CSS styling contributed to an aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interface. This project provided practical insights into React's fundamental principles.
